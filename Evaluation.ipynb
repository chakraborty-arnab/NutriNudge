The Dietary Guidelines is just one piece of the nutrition guidance landscape, however. Other guidance is designed to address requirements for the specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages or to address treatments for individuals who have a chronic disease. The following section describes the role of the Dietary Guidelines within this larger nutrition guidance landscape.\\nQuantitative Guidance on Foods,  \\nNot Nutrient Requirements\\nNutrient requirements are established and updated \\nby the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. At the request of the U.S. and Canadian Federal Governments, the Academies set the quantitative requirements or limits—known as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)—on nutrients, which include macronutrients (i.e., protein, carbohydrates, and fats), vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin C, iron, and sodium), and food components (e.g., dietary fiber).\\nBecause foods provide an array of nutrients and other \\ncomponents that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. Thus, the Dietary Guidelines translates the Academies’ nutrient requirements into food and beverage recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines recognizes, \\nthough, that in some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\\nHealth Promotion, Not Disease Treatment\\nAt its core, the Dietary Guidelines has a public health',\n",

This edition marks the first time the \\nGuidelines provide recommendations by life stage, from birth through older adulthood. \\nEach stage of life is distinct and has unique needs that affect health and disease risk. Early food preferences influence \\nfood and beverage choices later. And the science has evolved to focus on the importance of a healthy dietary pattern over time. The science also shows it’s never too late to start and maintain a healthy dietary pattern, which can yield health benefits in the short term and cumulatively over years. This new edition of the Dietary Guidelines includes \\nspecific recommendations for all life stages, now including infants and toddlers, and pregnant and lactating women. We are excited this is the first edition to provide guidance for every life stage.\\nThis edition of the Dietary Guidelines is grounded in robust scientific reviews of the current body of evidence on key \\nnutrition and health topics for each life stage. We thank the 20 distinguished scientists on the 2020 Dietary Guidelines \\nAdvisory Committee for their expertise and dedication in conducting an independent scientific review that was characterized by more transparency and public participation throughout the process than ever before. The Committee’s work culminated in a comprehensive scientific report on the current state of nutrition science and provided advice to the Departments for our development of this 9th edition of the Dietary Guidelines.

The scientific \\nconnection between food and health has been well documented for many decades, with substantial and increasingly robust evidence showing that a healthy lifestyle—including following a healthy dietary pattern—can help people achieve and maintain good health and reduce the risk of chronic diseases throughout all stages of the lifespan: infancy and toddlerhood, childhood and adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy and lactation, and older adulthood. The core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes.\\nSince the first edition was published in 1980, the  Dietary \\nGuidelines for Americans  have provided science-based \\nadvice on what to eat and drink to promote health, \\nreduce risk of chronic disease, and meet nutrient needs.

The Dietary Guidelines is just one piece of the nutrition guidance landscape, however. Other guidance is designed to address requirements for the specific nutrients contained in foods and beverages or to address treatments for individuals who have a chronic disease. The following section describes the role of the Dietary Guidelines within this larger nutrition guidance landscape.\\nQuantitative Guidance on Foods,  \\nNot Nutrient Requirements\\nNutrient requirements are established and updated \\nby the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. At the request of the U.S. and Canadian Federal Governments, the Academies set the quantitative requirements or limits—known as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)—on nutrients, which include macronutrients (i.e., protein, carbohydrates, and fats), vitamins and minerals (e.g., vitamin C, iron, and sodium), and food components (e.g., dietary fiber).\\nBecause foods provide an array of nutrients and other \\ncomponents that have benefits for health, nutritional needs should be met primarily through foods. Thus, the Dietary Guidelines translates the Academies’ nutrient requirements into food and beverage recommendations. The Dietary Guidelines recognizes, \\nthough, that in some cases, fortified foods and dietary supplements are useful when it is not possible otherwise to meet needs for one or more nutrients (e.g., during specific life stages such as pregnancy).\\nHealth Promotion, Not Disease Treatment\\nAt its core, the Dietary Guidelines has a public health',\n",

If human milk is unavailable, infants should be fed an iron-fortified commercial infant formula (i.e., labeled “with iron”) regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which are based on standards that ensure nutrient content and safety. Healthy eating continues with the introduction of complementary foods and beverages at about 6 months of age. By 12 months, infants should maintain their healthy eating as they transition to developmentally appropriate foods and beverages. Healthy eating continues in each life stage thereafter. Even though nutrient needs vary across life stages, the foods and beverages that individuals should eat over the lifespan are remarkably consistent. \\nThis chapter provides foundational guidance about \\nmaintaining a healthy dietary pattern across each life stage—infancy, toddlerhood, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, pregnancy, lactation, and older adulthood. Because the nutritional needs and transition of infants and toddlers are unique, Chapter 2  provides a focused \\ndiscussion on this age group. Chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6  \\nthen provide tailored nutrition information specific to children and adolescents, adults, women who are pregnant or lactating, and older adults, respectively. \\nWhat Is a Dietary Pattern?\\nOver the course of any given day, week, or year, individuals consume foods and beverages\\n1 in',\n",

A dietary pattern represents the totality of what individuals habitually eat and drink, and the parts of the pattern act synergistically to affect health. As a result, the dietary pattern may better predict overall health status and disease risk than individual foods or nutrients. \\nA healthy dietary pattern consists of nutrient-dense forms of foods and beverages across all food groups, \\nin recommended amounts, and within calorie limits. Achieving a healthy dietary pattern at each life stage not only supports health at that point in time, but also supports health in the next life stage and possibly for future generations. If healthy dietary patterns can be established early in life and sustained thereafter, the impact on health could be significant. Establishing  \\nand maintaining a healthy dietary pattern can help minimize diet-related chronic disease risk. Conversely, consuming foods and beverages that are not nutrient-dense may lead to disease expression in later years. High intakes of such foods (i.e., an unhealthy dietary pattern) throughout the lifespan can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. \\nThe good news is that at any stage of life, individuals \\ncan make efforts to adopt a healthy dietary pattern and improve their health. The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern, USDA’s primary Dietary Pattern, provides a framework for healthy eating that all Americans can follow. It is based on the types and proportions of foods Americans of all ages, genders, races, and ethnicities typically consume, but in nutrient-dense forms and appropriate amounts. \\nThe Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern is carried forward \\nfrom the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans . \\nThe 2,000-calorie level of the pattern is shown in Table 1-1 .

In some cases, when meeting nutrient needs is not otherwise possible, fortified foods and  \\nnutrient-containing dietary supplements are useful. It is important to note that the nutrient density and healthfulness of what people eat and drink  \\noften is determined ultimately by how a food item, dish, or meal is prepared, at home and away from home or produced by a manufacturer. Based on  \\nthe U.S. food supply and marketplace, the examples of healthy dietary patterns in this edition are achievable through thoughtful, informed choices one decision, one meal, one day at a time—and consistently over time. \\nCHOOSE A VARIETY OF OPTIONS FROM EACH FOOD GROUP \\nEnjoy different foods and beverages within each food group. This can \\nhelp meet nutrient needs—and also allows for flexibility so that the Dietary \\nGuidelines  can be tailored to meet cultural and personal preferences.  \\nAll forms of foods, including fresh, canned, dried, frozen, and 100% juices,  \\nin nutrient-dense forms, can be included in healthy dietary patterns. \\nPAY ATTENTION TO PORTION SIZE\\nPortion size  is a term often used to describe the amount of a food or',\n",

Vegetables, when consumed on their own, are generally consumed in forms with additional sodium either from salt added in cooking or added sauces such as soy sauce or bottled stir-fry sauces. Many vegetables are consumed as part of mixed dishes like sandwiches, pasta with a tomato-based sauce, or casseroles that may have other ingredients that are sources of saturated fat and/or sodium.\\nFor most individuals, following a healthy eating pattern will \\nrequire an increase in total vegetable intake and from all vegetable subgroups, shifting to nutrient-dense forms, and an increase in the variety of different vegetables consumed over time.

The foods in this vegetable subgroup have not changed. However, the new name of the subgroup more accurately reflects the category of foods included. Beans include varieties such as kidney beans, pinto beans, white beans, black beans, lima beans, and fava beans. Also included are dried peas (e.g., chickpeas, black-eyed peas, pigeon peas, and split peas) and lentils. Edamame, which is the soybean in the pod, is counted in the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup even though it is eaten fresh and not dried.\\nBecause beans, peas, and lentils have a similar \\nnutrient profile to foods in both the vegetable group and the protein foods group, they may be thought of as either a vegetable or a protein food when aiming to meet recommended intakes. \\nGreen peas and green (string) beans are \\nnot counted in the beans, peas, and lentils subgroup because the nutrient content of these vegetables is more similar to vegetables in other subgroups. Green peas, which are not dried before consumption, are grouped with starchy vegetables and green beans are in the other vegetables subgroup, which includes onions, iceberg lettuce, celery, and cabbage.

At least half of the recommended amount of fruit should come from whole fruit, rather than 100% juice. When juices are consumed, they should be 100% juice and always pasteurized or 100% juice diluted with water (without added sugars). Also, when selecting canned fruit, choose options  \\nthat are canned with 100% juice or options lowest in added sugars. \\nAbout 80 percent of the U.S. population does not meet \\nfruit recommendations. Over 60 percent of all fruit intake comes from whole forms—fresh, canned, frozen, or dried—or 100% juice.

Individuals who are lactose intolerant can choose low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products. For individuals who choose dairy alternatives, fortified soy beverages (commonly known as “soy milk”) and soy yogurt—which are fortified with calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin D—are included as part of the dairy group because they are similar to milk and yogurt based on nutrient composition and in their use in meals. \\nOther products sold as “milks” but made from plants \\n(e.g., almond, rice, coconut, oat, and hemp “milks”) may contain calcium and be consumed as a source of calcium, but they are not included as part of the dairy group because their overall nutritional content is not similar to dairy milk and fortified soy beverages. Therefore, consuming these beverages does not contribute to meeting the dairy group recommendation. \\nAbout 90 percent of the U.S. population does not meet \\ndairy recommendations. The percent of Americans who drink milk as a beverage on a given day is 65 percent among young children, 34 percent in adolescents, and \\nabout 20 percent for adults.

Individuals in their own homes can help keep food safe by following safe food handling practices. Four basic food safety principles work together to reduce the risk of foodborne illness—Clean, Separate, Cook, and Chill. \\n1: Clean \\nWash hands and \\nsurfaces often.2: Separate \\nSeparate raw meats \\nfrom other foods.3: Cook \\nCook food to safe \\ninternal temperatures.4: Chill \\nRefrigerate foods \\npromptly.\\n Some eating behaviors, such as consuming raw, undercooked, or unpasteurized food products, increase the risk of contracting a foodborne illness. Populations at increased risk of foodborne illness, or those preparing food for them, should use extra caution. These include women who are pregnant, young children, and older adults. Specific guidance for these life stages is discussed in subsequent chapters. Individuals with weakened immune systems are also at increased risk for foodborne illness.

Once an infant is developmentally ready, foods and beverages should be introduced to complement human milk feeding. These complementary foods and beverages are essential to meet the nutrient requirements of infants starting at about age 6 months and should be selected carefully to help meet these needs.

Offering young children whole grains more often than refined grains will increase dietary fiber as well as potassium intake during the second year  \\nof life and help young children establish healthy  \\ndietary practices. \\n 1 U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

This is because the nutrient requirements for infants \\nand young children are quite high relative to their size, but the amount \\nof complementary foods they consume is small. Complementary \\nfoods need to be nutrient-dense and not contain additional calories \\nfrom added sugars. In addition, low- and no-calorie sweeteners, which \\ncan also be called high-intensity sweeteners, are not recommended \\nfor children younger than age 2. Taste preferences are being formed \\nduring this time period, and infants and young children may develop \\npreferences for overly sweet foods if introduced to very sweet foods \\nduring this timeframe. For more information on added sugars,  \\nsee Chapter 1 .\\nAvoid Foods Higher in Sodium\\nSodium is found in a number of foods, including some salty snacks, \\ncommercial toddler foods, and processed meats. In addition to \\nkeeping sodium intake within limits for toddlers (see Appendix 1 ), \\nanother reason to avoid high-sodium foods is that taste preferences \\nfor salty food may be established early in life. Choose fresh or \\nlow-sodium frozen foods, when available, and low-sodium canned \\nfoods to minimize sodium content. For more information on sodium, \\nsee Chapter 1 .\\nAvoid Honey and Unpasteurized Foods and Beverages\\nInfants should not be given any foods containing raw or cooked \\nhoney. Honey can contain the Clostridium botulinum  organism that \\ncould cause serious illness or death among infants. Infants and \\nyoung children also should not be given any unpasteurized foods or \\nbeverages, such as unpasteurized juices, milk, yogurt, or cheeses, as \\nthey could contain harmful bacteria.\\nEstablish a Healthy Beverage Pattern',\n",

They may \\ncome in different flavors and some forms have added \\nsugars. Unsweetened versions of these beverages may \\nbe accommodated in small amounts in the diet during \\nthe second year of life, but most have significantly \\nless protein than cow milk and are not always fortified \\nwith calcium and vitamin D. Among plant-based milk \\nalternatives, only fortified soy beverage is currently \\nconsidered a dairy equivalent. Thus, consuming other \\nplant-based beverages does not contribute to meeting \\ndairy recommendations.\\n100% FRUIT JUICE\\nBefore age 12 months, 100% fruit or vegetable juices \\nshould not be given to infants. In the second year of \\nlife, fruit juice is not necessary, and most fruit intake \\nshould come from eating whole fruit.

Calories and nutrients should predominantly be met from a healthy dietary pattern of age-appropriate foods and beverages. The Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern presented here is intended for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who no longer consume human milk or infant formula. The pattern represents the types and amounts of foods needed to meet energy and nutrition requirements for this period ( Table 2-1). For toddlers who \\nare still consuming human milk (approximately one-third at 12 months and 15 percent at 18 months), a healthy dietary pattern should include a similar combination of nutrient-dense complementary foods and beverages. \\nTable 2-1 displays the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary  \\nPattern to illustrate the specific amounts and limits  \\nfor food groups and other dietary components that  \\nmake up healthy dietary patterns. The pattern is  \\nprovided at calorie levels ranging from 700 to 1,000 calories per day, which are appropriate for most  \\ntoddlers ages 12 through 23 months (see Appendix 2. \\nEstimated Calorie Needs ). A healthy dietary  pattern includes a variety of nutrient-dense fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods (including lean  \\nmeats, poultry, eggs, seafood, nuts, and seeds), dairy (including milk, yogurt, and cheese), and oils. Based on FDA and EPA’s joint “Advice About Eating Fish,” young children should eat seafood lowest in methylmercury, and certain species of seafood should be avoided.\\n2 If \\nyoung children are lower in body weight, they should eat less seafood than the amounts in the Healthy U.S.-Style Dietary Pattern.

Young children are fully reliant on others to provide their meals and snacks. As children transition to school-age and through adolescence, they are exposed to new food choices and begin to have more autonomy in the foods that are selected. New influences on eating behavior also emerge, such as peer pressure, which can create opportunities or challenges for establishing dietary patterns consistent with health and longevity. Adolescents acquire ever-greater independence in their food choices as they mature, with more time spent on their own with peers  \\nand more foods and beverages frequently consumed in social settings. Other factors that influence eating behavior include social supports, exposure to food marketing and promotion, and policies that determine community design. \\nYouth have diverse calorie and nutrient needs based on age and patterns',\n",

Overweight and obesity put youth at high risk of serious health concerns. Youth with obesity are more likely to have immediate health risks, including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and impaired glucose tolerance. They also are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes beginning as soon as the teenage years and into adulthood. Psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression) and social concerns (e.g., bullying, stigma) also are more likely in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. \\nThe causes of childhood obesity are complex and interconnected. Behaviors (e.g., eating habits, level of physical \\nactivity, sedentary time) and the community in which a child or adolescent resides can influence risk of obesity. Genetics and the fetal environment also play a role in the development of obesity. However, many opportunities exist to help prevent or manage overweight and obesity as children transition through these life stages. The goal for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity is to reduce the rate of weight gain while allowing normal growth and development. This can primarily be done by emphasizing nutrient-dense food and beverage choices, minimizing calories from sources that do not contribute to a healthy dietary pattern, and encouraging regular physical activity.\\nHealthy Dietary \\nPatterns\\nChildren and adolescents are encouraged to follow the \\nrecommendations on the types of foods and beverages that make up a healthy dietary pattern described in Chapter 1.

Milk consumption, particularly milk as a beverage, is lower and cheese intake, typically as part of mixed dishes such as sandwiches, pizza, or pasta, is higher among adolescents when compared to younger children. These differences in consumption occur alongside the widening gap between current and recommended intakes of dairy foods that occurs throughout youth. Nutrient-dense options within the dairy group are unsweetened fat-free and low-fat (1%) milk, yogurt, cheese, fortified soy beverages and yogurt, and low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products. Dairy and fortified soy alternatives provide protein and a variety of nutrients that are underconsumed during these life stages. These include three nutrients of public health concern discussed in Chapter 1 : potassium, calcium, \\nand vitamin D. The nutrient composition of dairy foods highlights the importance of adequate consumption. This is especially relevant for calcium and vitamin D, given that adolescents have an increased need for consumption to support the accrual of bone mass. \\nAdolescent Nutrition',\n",

As a result, adolescents are at greater risk of dietary inadequacy than are other age groups. For adolescent males and females, low intakes of nutrient-dense foods and beverages within the grains, dairy and alternatives, fruits, and vegetables food groups lead to low intakes of phosphorus, magnesium, and choline. Adolescent females also consume less meat, poultry, and eggs than do adolescent males, and in combination with low consumption of seafood and other protein subgroups, including beans, peas, and lentils, this results in the underconsumption of total protein. In addition, adolescent females have low dietary intakes of iron, folate, vitamin B\\n6, and vitamin B 12.

The \\nfollowing Government programs play an essential role \\nin providing access to healthy meals and educational \\nresources to support healthy dietary patterns for all \\nchildren and adolescents. \\n• The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \\n(SNAP)  provides temporary benefits to families with \\nqualifying incomes for the purchase of foods and \\nbeverages. About one-half of all SNAP participants  \\nare children.1 \\n• Households with young children may be eligible for  \\nthe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \\nWomen, Infants, and Children (WIC) . WIC can help \\nfamilies with limited resources meet their child’s \\nnutritional needs by providing nutritious foods to \\nsupplement diets. WIC serves children up to the age  \\nof 5 years who are at nutritional risk. \\n• In childcare and afterschool settings, the Child  \\nand Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)  can  \\nsupport the development of healthy dietary \\npatterns. CACFP is a nutrition program that provides \\nreimbursements for meals and snacks that align  \\nwith the Dietary Guidelines  to eligible children  \\nenrolled at childcare centers, daycare homes,  \\nand in afterschool programs. \\n• School-age children can benefit from the National \\nSchool Lunch Program and School Breakfast \\nProgram . The school meal programs can provide \\nnearly two-thirds of daily calories, and therefore play \\nan influential role in the development of a healthy \\ndietary pattern.• Outside of the school year, the Summer Food  \\nService Program (SFSP) fills the gap by ensuring  \\nthat children continue to receive nutritious meals  \\nwhen school is not in session. The SFSP operates  \\nat sites in a community where children can  \\nreceive nutritious meals in a safe and  \\nsupervised environment.',\n",

To attain the most health benefits from \\nphysical activity, adults need at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-\\nintensity aerobic activity, like brisk walking or fast dancing, each week. \\nAdults also need muscle-strengthening activity, like lifting weights or \\ndoing push-ups, at least 2 days each week. \\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Physical Activity \\nGuidelines for Americans  and related Move Your Way® resources have \\nmore information about the benefits of physical activity and tips on how \\nto get started.

These considerations include a focus on dietary changes to increase intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and vitamin D and to decrease intakes of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. Special considerations related to alcoholic beverages also  \\nare discussed.\\nDietary Fiber\\nDietary patterns that do not meet recommended intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains contribute to low intakes of dietary fiber. More than 90 percent of women and 97 percent of men do not meet recommended intakes for dietary fiber. This aligns with intake patterns where fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are underconsumed by more than 85 percent of adults. Appendix 1. Nutritional Goals for \\nAge-Sex Groups provides dietary fiber goals for men and women based on the Dietary Reference Intakes. These recommendations are based on levels observed to reduce risk of coronary heart disease. Increasing intakes of fruits, vegetables, and replacing refined grains with whole grains to improve dietary fiber intakes is especially important during this life stage, as the impact of poor diet quality becomes apparent with the onset and/or progression of diet-related chronic diseases. Chapter 1  provides strategies on how to \\nincrease intakes of these important food groups.

Close to 30 percent of men and 60 percent of women older than age 19 years do not consume enough calcium, and more than 90 percent do not consume enough vitamin D. Dietary patterns that do not meet recommended intake amounts for food groups and subgroups, which include sources of calcium and vitamin D—such as dairy foods and fortified soy alternatives and seafood—contribute to low intake of these nutrients. Particular attention should be given to consuming adequate amounts of foods with these nutrients during adult years to promote optimal bone health and prevent the onset of osteoporosis. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is particularly important for adults during the time period when peak bone mass is still actively accruing (ages 19 through about 30) and, for women, in the post-menopausal period when rapid bone remodeling occurs.\\nA healthy dietary pattern with nutrient-dense, \\ncalcium-rich foods, such as low-fat milk and yogurt and fortified soy alternatives and canned sardines and salmon, can help adults better meet intake recommendations. Vitamin D aids in the absorption of calcium. Consuming the recommended amount of seafood and choosing foods that are fortified with vitamin D, including milk, fortified soy beverages, and \\nfortified soy yogurt , and some whole-grain cereals, \\ncan help adults meet their needs.

However, \\nthis may be difficult for some women, especially \\nthose who are pregnant. Most healthcare providers \\nrecommend women who are pregnant or planning to \\nbecome pregnant take a daily prenatal vitamin and \\nmineral supplement in addition to consuming a healthy \\ndietary pattern.

Constraints \\non time and financial resources, limited access to high-quality childcare and family leave policies, as well as inadequate breastfeeding support at home or at work are barriers women may face. These barriers should be considered by all those who support women in their efforts to follow a healthy dietary pattern. \\nEnsuring women have access to healthy, safe food \\nis vital due to the critical role nutrition plays in health promotion during these life stages. This is particularly critical for families dealing with food insecurity, which is most prevalent in households with children and in single-parent households. Participation in Federal programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition \\nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which serves low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, and infants and children up to age 5, can help alleviate these challenges and improve dietary intake for many women and children facing economic hardship.

Compared to younger adults, older adults are at greater risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as health \\nconditions related to changes in bone and \\nmuscle mass, such as osteoporosis and sarcopenia, respectively. An increasing number of older adults start this life stage with excess body weight. Preventing additional weight gain and achieving a \\nhealthy weight by following a healthy \\ndietary pattern and adopting an active lifestyle can support healthy aging.\\nSelecting healthy food and beverage choices is important for people \\nthroughout this life stage, regardless of their race or ethnicity or their current health status. It is never too late to make improvements. Older adults should follow a healthy dietary pattern because of the changing dietary needs and the heightened risk of malnutrition that occurs with age. Older adults generally have lower calorie needs but similar or even increased nutrient needs compared to younger adults. The overall nutrient density of dietary patterns is particularly important to this age group. Lower calorie needs result from less physical activity, changes in metabolism, and/or age-related loss in bone and muscle mass. Other factors may affect nutrient needs and absorption of nutrients in older adults, including chronic disease and conditions, use of multiple medications, and changes in body composition. The healthy dietary patterns described below take the unique needs of older adults into account and are further supported by special considerations and strategies for professionals to support healthy aging.Nutrient-Dense Foods \\nand Beverages \\nNutrient-dense foods and',\n",

Older adults who experience difficulty leaving the home due to frailty, health concerns, or certain medical conditions may benefit from home-delivered meals offered under the Older Americans Act. \\n• Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP): The CACFP is a Federal program that provides reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks to older adults enrolled in daycare facilities. Older adults receiving care at nonresidential care centers may receive meals and snacks that meet nutrition standards of the CACFP .\\nAdditional resources to support older adults exist at the community level. For example, the Senior Farmers \\nMarket Nutrition Program (SFMNP)  provides many \\nlow-income seniors with access to fruits and vegetables grown in their local communities. SNAP Education \\n(SNAP-Ed)  programming may also be offered and teach older adults cooking and shopping skills. Individuals working within these settings must ensure the availability of nutrient-dense foods and assist older adults in choosing a healthy dietary pattern that fits in their cultural and food preferences.   \\nHealthy Eating \\nThrough the Lifespan\\nThis chapter has focused on the unique nutritional \\nconsiderations of the older adult life stage. It also has reinforced the idea that the core elements of a healthy dietary pattern are remarkably consistent across the lifespan and across health outcomes. More than that, a healthy dietary pattern is flexible—people can customize the Dietary Guidelines recommendations to suit their personal preferences, cultural traditions, and budget considerations. \\nBeginning at the earliest life stage—infancy and',\n",

In addition, a need to lose, maintain, or gain weight, and other factors affect how many calories should be consumed. Estimated amounts of calories needed to maintain energy balance for various age and sex groups at three different levels of physical activity are provided in Table A2-1  for toddlers ages 12 through \\n23 months and Table A2-2  for ages 2 and older. These estimates are based on the Estimated Energy Requirements \\n(EER) equations, using reference heights (average) and reference weights (healthy) for each age-sex group. For toddlers, children, and adolescents, reference height and weight vary by age. For adults, the reference man is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs 154 pounds. The reference woman is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds. \\nEstimates range from 700 to 1,000 calories for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months. Estimated needs for young \\nchildren ages 2 through 8 range from 1,000 to 2,000 calories. A wider range of 1,400 to 3,200 calories is estimated for older children and adolescents, with males generally having higher calorie needs than females. \\nAdult estimated calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,400 calories per day for females and 2,000 to 3,000 calories per',\n",

The Healthy Vegetarian Dietary \\nPattern ( Tables A3-3  and A3-4 ) and the Healthy Mediterranean-Style Dietary Pattern ( Table A3-5 ) are variations \\nthat also exemplify a healthy dietary pattern. For the first time, the Healthy U.S.-Style and Healthy Vegetarian Dietary Patterns are provided for toddlers ages 12 through 23 months who are no longer receiving human milk or infant formula. These patterns are designed to meet nutrient needs while not exceeding calorie requirements and while staying within limits for overconsumed dietary components, such as added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. \\nThe methodology used to develop and update these Patterns builds on the rich history USDA has in developing food \\nguides. This methodology includes using current food consumption data to determine the mix and proportions of foods to include in each group. Food composition data is used to select a nutrient-dense representative for each food and calculate nutrient profiles for each food group. As would be expected, most foods in their nutrient-dense forms do contain some sodium and saturated fat. In a few cases, such as in the case of whole-wheat bread, the most appropriate representative in current Federal databases contains a small amount of added sugars. Detailed information about the representative foods, nutrient profiles, and patterns is available in the online appendix of the Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.\\n1\\nAmounts of each food group and subgroup within the patterns are based on nutrient and Dietary Guidelines',\n",

Standards for nutrient adequacy aim to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA), which are designed to cover the needs of 97 percent of the population, and Adequate Intakes (AI), which are used when an average nutrient requirement cannot be determined. The Patterns meet these standards for almost all nutrients. For a few nutrients (vitamin D and vitamin E for all ages, and choline for ages 2 and older), amounts in the Patterns are marginal or below the RDA or AI standard for many or all age/sex groups. In most cases, an intake of these nutrients below the RDA or AI is not considered to be of public health concern. For more information on dietary components of public health concern, see Chapter 1 .\\nThe Patterns have 12 calorie levels to meet the needs of individuals across the lifespan ages 2 and older. For toddlers ages 12 through 23 months, who are no longer receiving either human milk or infant formula, the Patterns are provided at 4 calorie levels. Chapters 2 , 3, 4, 5, and 6  describe healthy dietary patterns and relevant calorie levels \\nfor each life stage. To follow these Patterns, identify the appropriate calorie level, choose a variety of foods in each group and subgroup over time in recommended amounts, and limit choices that are not in nutrient-dense forms so that the overall calorie limit is not exceeded.
