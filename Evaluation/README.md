# NutriNudge Evaluations

## Overview
This project focuses on evaluating the performance and latency of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application: **NutriNudge**. 
We implemented and evaluated several methods to enhance the system's performance.

## Key Improvements
1. Modified prompt for concise answers
2. Implemented threshold-based retrieval

## Results
Our improvements led to:
- Increased accuracy and relevance scores
- Significant reduction in latency, especially for irrelevant queries
