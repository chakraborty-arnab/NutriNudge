# NutriNudge Evaluations
# RAG Application Performance Enhancement

## Overview
This project focuses on improving the latency and answer relevance of our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. We implemented and evaluated several methods to enhance the system's performance.

## Key Improvements
1. Modified prompt engineering for concise answers
2. Implemented threshold-based retrieval

## Results
Our improvements led to:
- Increased accuracy and relevance scores
- Significant reduction in latency, especially for irrelevant queries

## Detailed Report
For a comprehensive analysis of our methodology, improvements, results, and future work, please refer to our [detailed evaluation report](https://link-to-your-report.com).

## Next Steps
- Implement adaptive thresholding
- Explore dynamic prompt adjustment
- Investigate further latency reduction techniques
- Conduct user testing
